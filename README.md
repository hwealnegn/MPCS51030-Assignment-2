Grade: 9/10

Good job overall. Things to note: 

- Keep in mind that the iPhone screen is not always 320 pts wide! Try running the app on an iPhone 6 or 6+. Instead, frames should be dependent on the screen width 

- Use properties instead of instance variables - remember that it does a lot of behind-the-scenes work for you!

- Also, you no longer need to synthesize properties. So this line is no longer useful: 

> <pre><code>
> @synthesize mixedArray = _mixedArray;
> </code></pre>

- Be sure to include references if you looked at stack overflow or somewhere online for help!

- Additional point included in the score for playing sounds.
